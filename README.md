# rmrf_enter.py

`rmrf_enter.py` is a simple runner for scripts that describe which files they 
want to delete. 

Right now it's just deletables, but I might introduce other actions in the 
future.

## installation

    $ python setup.py install

or installing via pip:

    pip install git+https://github.com/elifesciences/rmrf_enter.git@master

or in your `requirements.txt` file:

    git+https://github.com/elifesciences/rmrf_enter.git@master

## usage

See `example.py` for example usage of `rmrf_enter.py`.
